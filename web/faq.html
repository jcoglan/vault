      <h2>Who are you?</h2>

      <p>This site was made by <a href="http://jcoglan.com">James Coglan</a>. I
        write open-source software for the Web.</p>

      <h2>Why should I trust you?</h2>

      <p>This site does not store or transmit any data you enter into it; the
        information you type in never leaves your computer. It contains no
        analytics scripts, tracking cookies or other pieces of spyware. The
        passwords it generates are much more secure than most people use,
        against brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks and password database
        theft.</p>

      <p>According to <a
        href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/209/zxcvbn/test/index.html">Dropbox&rsquo;s
        zxcvbn password strength measure</a>, if your dictionary English
        password takes about a second to crack, those generated by Vault take
        over a million times the age of the observable universe to crack by
        brute force.</p>

      <h2>Fine, but I still don&rsquo;t trust you.</h2>

      <p>And why should you, after all I am just some guy from the Internet.
        However, this software is open-source (released under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a>)
        and you can <a href="http://github.com/jcoglan/vault">take a look at
        its source code</a>. The site is a few simple static files that anyone
        is free to host themselves.</p>

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>

      <p>It takes your passphrase and a service name and generates a hash from
        them using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a>. It
        then encodes the bits of this hash using a 94-character alphabet,
        subject to the given character constraints. This design means that each
        password is very hard to break by brute force, and ensures that the
        discovery of one service&rsquo;s password does not lead to other
        accounts being compromised. It also means you can tailor the output to
        the character set accepted by each service. The use of a deterministic
        hash function means we don&rsquo;t need to store your passwords since
        they can easily be regenerated; this means there&rsquo;s no storage to
        sync or keep secure.</p>

      <h2>What can I use as my passphrase?</h2>

      <p>Absolutely any text you like. A good passphrase should consist of a few
        words you can easily remember but would be hard to guess, like a
        quotation or a song lyric.</p>

      <p>Using a few words rather than some string of letters and numbers makes
        it easier for you to remember but harder for attackers to guess. But,
        many online services restrict the characters you can use, making you
        less safe. This tool lets you convert your passphrase into something
        each service will accept.</p>

      <h2>What should I use as a service name?</h2>

      <p>Again, this can be anything you like, it simply serves to modify your
        password and make it unique for every site you visit. Personally, I use
        the name of the site, as one word in lowercase, e.g. <tt>gmail</tt>.</p>

      <p>If you want to make sure your password is completely unique, that is
        make sure that even if you and someone else have the same master
        passphrase and use the same service, you get different generated
        passwords, you can prefix the service name with your username, e.g.
        <tt>bob@gmail</tt>.</p>

      <p>I also use a scheme to organise facets of a single group of passwords,
        for example at work I use <tt>songkick:ldap</tt> to log into our
        internal network, and <tt>songkick:blog</tt> to log into our Wordpress
        blog.</p>

      <p>The important thing is that it be something easy to remember based on
        the name of the site. If you forget your passphrase or the service name,
        Vault cannot recover your password for you.</p>

      <h2>How am I supposed to remember the character settings for each
        service?</h2>

      <p>I&rsquo;m working on that. In the mean time: just write them down.
        Unlike passwords, this information is public knowledge so it&rsquo;s
        totally safe to keep them in a file on your desktop or a piece of paper
        in your wallet.</p>

      <h2>Is there a command line version?</h2>

      <p>Of course there is. If you have <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node</a>
        installed, run <tt>npm install -g vault</tt>. You&rsquo;ll also want
        to take a look at the
        <a href="http://github.com/jcoglan/vault">readme</a>.</p>
